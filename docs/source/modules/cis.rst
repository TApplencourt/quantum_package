This module contains a CIS program, built by setting the following rules:

* The only generator determinant is the Hartree-Fock (single-reference method)
* All generated singly excited determinants are included in the wave function (no perturbative
  selection)

These rules are set in the ``H_apply.irp.f`` file.

        subroutine cis

    Configuration Interaction with Single excitations. 

    This program takes a reference Slater determinant of ROHF-like occupancy, 

    and performs all single excitations on top of it, disregarding spatial symmetry and compute the "n_states" lowest eigenstates of that CI matrix. (see :option:`determinants n_states`) 

    This program can be useful in many cases: 

    * GROUND STATE CALCULATION: to be sure to have the lowest scf solution, perform an scf (see the :ref:`hartree_fock` module), then a cis, 

    save the natural orbitals (see :ref:`save_natorb`) and reperform an scf optimization from this MO guess 

    

    

    * EXCITED STATES CALCULATIONS: the lowest excited states are much likely to be dominanted by single-excitations. 

    Therefore, running a cis will save the "n_states" lowest states within the CIS space 

    in the EZFIO folder, which can afterward be used as guess wave functions for a further 

    multi-state fci calculation if you specify "read_wf" = True before running the fci executable. 

    Also, if you specify "s2_eig" = True, the cis will only retain states having the good value :math:`S^2` value (see expected_s2). 

    If "s2_eig" = False, it will take the lowest n_states, whatever multiplicity they are. 

    

    

    Note: if you would like to discard some orbitals, use qp_set_mo_class to specify: 

    * "core" orbitals which will be always doubly occupied 

    * "act" orbitals where an electron can be either excited from or to 

    * "del" orbitals which will be never occupied





.. c:function:: h_apply_cis

    .. code:: text

        subroutine H_apply_cis()

    File: :file:`h_apply.irp.f_shell_8`

    Calls H_apply on the |HF| determinant and selects all connected single and double excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.
