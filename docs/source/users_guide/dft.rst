The DFT module uses Lebedev-Laikov grids, using the code distributed through CCL (http://www.ccl.net/).

       This subroutine is part of a set of subroutines that generate
       Lebedev grids [1-6] for integration on a sphere. The original 
       C-code [1] was kindly provided by Dr. Dmitri N. Laikov and 
       translated into fortran by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen.
       This subroutine was translated using a C to fortran77 conversion
       tool written by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen.
    
       Users of this code are asked to include reference [1] in their
       publications, and in the user- and programmers-manuals 
       describing their codes.
    
       This code was distributed through CCL (http://www.ccl.net/).
