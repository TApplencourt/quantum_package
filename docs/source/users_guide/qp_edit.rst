.. TODO

This command reads the content of the |EZFIO| directory and creates a temporary
file containing the data. The data is presented as a *ReStructured Text* (rst)
document, where each section corresponds to the corresponding |qp| module.
The content of the file can be modified to change the input parameters. When
the text editor is closed, the updated data is saved into the |EZFIO| directory.

.. note::
   The text editor which will be opened is defined by the :envvar:`EDITOR`
   environment variable.
   
.. warning::
   When the wave function is too large (more than 10 000 determinants), the
   determinants are not displayed.

Usage
-----

.. code:: bash

    qp_edit [FLAGS] <EZFIO_DIRECTORY>
    Flags :
      [-c]          [-ndet int]
      [-state int]  [-help]


.. option:: -c

   Checks the input data

.. option:: -ndet <int>

   Truncates the wavefunction to the target number of determinants

.. option:: -state <int>

   Pick the target state as a new wavefunction.

.. option:: -help

   Print the help text and exits


Here is a short list of important control parameters :

.. option:: read_wf

   If ``false``, initialize the calculation with a single-determinant wave
   function. If ``true``, initialize the calculation with the wave function stored
   in the |EZFIO| directory.
