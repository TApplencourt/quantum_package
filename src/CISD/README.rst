CISD
====

This module contains a CISD program, built by setting the following rules:

* The only generator determinant is the Hartree-Fock (single-reference method)
* All generated determinants are included in the wave function (no perturbative
  selection)

These rules are set in the ``H_apply.irp.f`` file.
