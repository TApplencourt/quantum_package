Davidson_Utils
==============

Abstract module for Davidson diagonalization. Contains everything required for the
Davidson algorithm, dressed or not. If a dressing is used, the dressing column should
be defined and the DavidsonDressed module should be used. If no dressing is required,
the Davidson module should be used, and it has a default null dressing vector.
