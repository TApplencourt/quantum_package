Davidson_Utils
==============

Abstract module for Davidson's diagonalization.
It contains everything required for the Davidson algorithm, dressed or not. If
a dressing is used, the dressing column should be defined and the
:ref:`davidsondressed` module should be used. If no dressing is required,
the :ref:`davidson` module should be used, and it has a default zero dressing vector.
